<p>My name is Emily Veit, and I am currently a junior here at Michigan State University. I was born in Boston, MA, but was raised in Haslett, MI, thereby making me a 'townie' since my hometown is so close to our campus. I am an active member of Chi Omega Sorority, and could not enjoy being a part of the Greek community more. It offers unique opportunities,  both from a philanthropic and social standpoint, and allows me to be involved in so many different activities throughout our university. I am currently our chapters 'Career and Personal Development' chair, which means I help our chapter in a wide array of ways, from hosting internship and interview workshops to self defense classes. I am also a member of the Spartan Ski Club here at MSU, which is so much fun! Not only do they hold tailgates, hayrides, and other fun events throughout the year, but also amazing ski trips in the winter. I am employed by  TechSmith Corporation and work as a Graphic Design Intern.  I am responsible for the stylistic and artistic direction of all marketing deliverables, including website content, print and interactive advertising, trade show materials, packaging, email campaign communications, and more. I have been employed here since May, and am fortunate enough to be keeping this internship throughout the school year. I am learning so mcuh about working in a creative marketing environment, and even more about graphic design. I enjoy traveling whenever I have the opportunity. I have traveled many places throughout the United States, and last summer I spent five weeks in Singapore and Thailand. My family's cottage up north has always been a special place, and we spend as much time up their as we can, along with our friends and dog, Remy.</p>

<p>I am majoring in Media and Information, currently specializing in Design and Digital Humanities. Throughout my life I have always been the 'left-brained' one among my family of 'right-brains', and apply my creativeness to everything that I do. By having these extra specializations, I am really hoping to achieve a unique skill set that includes both website and layout design ideas that I can apply in many different ways.  They will allow me to learn and master the foundations and core concepts of design. I am particularly interested in understanding non web-based design concepts since they are the foundation of any web design. Overall, I have and continue to learn so much from the wide range of classes I take at MSU, and am so excited for what the future has in store for me.</p>

           	  <h4>Website Development</h4>
           	  <p>Through my Digital Humanities courses at MSU and my experience as a Graphic Design Intern, I have been able to get experience in different aspects of website development. From using basic HTML and CSS to create emails to be sent to customers, to working in the companies CMS, I have used my creativity to do and learn much more than I could have imagined possible. </p>

           	  <h4>Image Creation</h4>
           	  <p>At my internship, I am responsible for anything the company may need for any creative project. i have found that I am relied on heavily to create new and updated images to be used online, whether they be for new product releases or just updating old pages that remain on our website. I have taken new photographs, or created them from scratch in order to portray whatever may be needed.</p>

           	  <h4>Print Creation</h4>
           	  <p>I have had a lot of experience creating print work throughout my college years and before. I have worked on magazine layouts as well as basic print ads and such. It is a different skill set versus website development, and one that I enjoy the challenge of. Being able to look at work in your hands versus on a computer monitor is a rewarding experience, especially knowing it is going directly into customers hands too!</p>

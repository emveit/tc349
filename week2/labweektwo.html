She was drawn to this industry by the experience she had in creative classes such as art, yearbook, and television production in high school. She loved the freedom she had with projects, and how she was learning about things she was truly interested in.

This was an excellent experience, and taught her an endless amount about interacting with customers, working in teams, handling conflicts, time management, among many other things. Emily is now a graphic design intern at company in Okemos Michigan called TechSmith Corporation, which specializes in screen recording and video editing software. Her role supports integrated marketing efforts through idea generation, and creating original artwork through to publishing or production. She works hard on the artistic direction of all marketing deliverables, including website content, print and interactive advertising, trade show materials, packaging, email campaigns, and more. In addition to school and working, Emily is an active member of Chi Omega fraternity, and holds the Career and Personal Development position within the chapter.

<h2>Critique of Panic.com</h2>

<p>Panic.com is a company I actually am familiar with. I have used both Coda and Transmit previously, and enjoy both of the products immensely. Their website on the other hand is not something I am thrilled with. The first thing I notice when I visit the main panic.com page is how the bottom icons are cut off from readers viewing their entirety because of how large the overall graphic is. I think that is definitely a design flaw because it is not visually appealing. I think it is more effective if viewers do not have to scroll to see the main part/point of the page.  I do like the rollover effect on the images and how it shows your more information about the product. I do not like the triangle graphic that is underneath the icons; it seems to be much more of a distraction than visually appealing. I think if they were to get rid of the triangle and move the footer up in its place it would make the customer focus directly on clicking on one of the apps and make the overall style of the page much cleaner. </p>

<p>When you go to the pages that are specific to the apps, it looks like they were trying to design it like apple.com or evernote.com, with the sections split up in rows where you scroll for a bit in order to see all the information. This design concept seems to be a major theme among many sites currently. I think only some sites pull it off successfully, and unfortunately I do not think panic.com was one of them. The spacing in the different sections seems to be off, which makes reading the copy somewhat hard. I also do not think they used images to their advantage, because they seem to be randomly placed throughout the pages. Also, one would never know that the image on Codas page, for example, is a video unless they happen to click on the 'Coda Tour' button. That is definitely a user experience issue. If people do not know that it is going to provide them with more information, chances are that they are going to skim right over it. The pages are not consistent in their designs, for example I think the Transit page is much more successful with displaying relevant information in a way that viewers can easily consume. Prompts page is terrible- personally I have no idea what the product does and the page does not explain it at all minus saying in tiny print 'A very nice SSH client for iOS'. There is the option to click the small panic button in the top left corner in order to go back to the main page, but I think they need to make that more prominent because it is not the most user-friendly navigation strategy.  </p>

<p>Overall, I do not think the site is terrible, but I think they could do tweaks to the design to make the user experience better/easier. Their content is the most important part of the site, and if they want their readers to successfully absorb it, they need to present it in an easier way. It also seems that they are trying to have customers recognize the individual apps by their symbols (like the leaf, truck, magnet, etc.) because they do not make the title of the app prominent on the pages. I think it would make more sense for brand recognition for the company overall if they were to use the blue 'p.' that they use on the main page as the button you click to navigate back to the main page. Then not only would customers recognize the app symbols, but also the brand. Panic.com's website it definitely not the worst, but it could be better! </p>
